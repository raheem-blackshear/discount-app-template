                <h3>Welcome to Discount</h3>
                <p>We need to tackle water and fuel poverty – and water efficiency cuts bills and energy use. It’s also central to moving to a more customer-led water sector which can keep up with other sectors.</p>
                <p>There is already a great deal of excellent water efficiency work involving a range of factors being undertaken across the UK – through setting out focused recommendations and actions, this strategy is providing a framework via which we can drive even more ambitious water efficiency action and ensure future work is focussed on key areas.</p>

                <p>
                    The strategy was developed in consultation with the water sector – including Discount supporters and the Water UK-supported steering group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The strategy sets out a blueprint to deliver a vision of a UK in which all people, homes and businesses are water-efficient, and where water is used wisely, every day, everywhere.
